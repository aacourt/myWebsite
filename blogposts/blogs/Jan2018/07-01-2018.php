            <p> 2017. My oh my what a year, and didn't it fly by! I feel like I've blinked and suddenly it's a whole new year? 2017 was actually a good year for me. I graduated from my degree with a first, I got myself a job on a graduate scheme were I'm actually happy, I started renting my first proper house, I passed my driving test (on the second try lol who needs to pass first time anyway), got my first car, met my lovely boyfriend and even started my own candle business on etsy! WHEWWW come on then 2018, can you top that? </p>

            Well to put it bluntly, it's going to take a lot. And I need to make it happen!! So in the spirit of cheesy new year cliches, I'm going full throttle with the whole 'new year, new me'. STARTING WITH THIS NEW BLOG DESIGN OOOOO. Being a computer scientist and a somewhat half decent programmer, I decided, rather than doing the nice and easy thing of upgrading and hosting my current site through wordpress, why not have a nice clean start and program my own site? And here we are! This site you're on right now is all painstakingly programmed by yours truly. So it may not be as slick and swanky as some other bloggers but at least I can say it's unique and I did it all by myself. </p>

            Another thing I am determined to do is to lose weight. EVERY YEAR I say this but you know what 2018 I'm feeling good about you. In all fairness this isn't a new goal that I'm starting this Jan. I began this journey at the end of 2017 when enough was enough and I just hated looking in the mirror. I knew my eating habits had to change and that I needed to be more active. So now I'm easing into little daily workouts and the food I eat is so much healthier and I'm already seeing subtle differences. So more than anything I want to keep up this goal and finally get to a body I'm proud of. </p>

            Another part of 'new year, new me', calls for a nice and terrifying drastic hair change, no? I'm such a wuss when it comes to hair, I've never really changed it, besides the slight balayage almost 2 years ago. This is only because my hair grows at snail pace. Super. Duper. Slow. So I always wanted a change but never had the guts to commit. SO, what better time to change it than now? Well to be honest there were probably better times but my hair is in such dire condition it needed a cut anyway SO I GREW SOME LADY BALLS and picked up the phone and booked it. I am going shorter and a whoooooole lot blonder. But still with balayage because cba with the commitment of dying roots looool no shame. So yeah, that's bloomin terrifying, but equally so so exciting, finally a change!  I can tell I'll miss having long hair but hey in like 10 years time it'll have grown back to this length ahah *inward crying* . Look out for pics of that come the end of Jan (unless I look crap ahaa in which case see you in 2019 when I'm over it).

            </br></br>

            So there you have it, my current 2018 fresh start, blogwise, lifewise and hairwise. All very exciting things! I hope you enjoyed this first new post and my whole blog overhaul, here's to 2018 and me attempting to get back into blogging woooo! Have a great new year everyone!
