            <p> 
            HI ALL. It's been a while since I released some new candles ( and wrote a new blog post for that matter! ), so I'm super excited to announce to you the 4 new candles added to my permanent collection! They are Manon, Amortentia, So Fetch and Curling up with a Good Book. Below I'll show you some pictures of the candles and include their etsy descriptions to tell you a bit more about them.  </p>
            <p>
            First up we have "Curling up with a Good Book". </p><p> This gorgeous cream candle topped with a dusty gold glitter, is the ultimate must have for those cold nights when all you want to do is just curl up with a good book. It's the ultimate cosy blend of scents, containing notes of cinnamon, clove, vanilla and toasted marshmallow. Perfect for lighting while you get all snuggled up. </p>

            <p>
            Next up we've got "So Fetch! " </p><p>This hot pink, with holographic pink glitter on top is so fetch! Smelling super sweet of pink champagne and strawberry syrup this candle isn't one to miss. Plus you know I'm kinda psychic, my fifth sense is telling me you'll love it! </p>

            <p>
            Next we have "Manon" </p>
            <p> This beautiful vibrant red candle topped with red glitter is inspired by the everyone's favourite witch, Manon Blackbeak from the Throne of Glass series. The candle smells of punchy black cherry, paired with a citrusy kick of lime! Almost good enough to sink your (iron)teeth into. </p>

            <p>
            Finally we have "Amortentia" </p> <p>
            Fall in love with this gorgeous turquoise candle with rose gold glitter! Based off the deadly love potion in Harry Potter and the Half Blood prince, this entrancing candle smells of lovely sweet strawberries and raspberries and a hint of marshmallow. </p>
