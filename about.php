        Hi all and welcome to my site!
        </br></br>
        My names Abby and I've recently graduated from university with a first class degree in Computer Science. I'm now working full time as a junior software developer. Alongside loving all things techie, I also love to be creative, hence why this blog began.Â 
        </br></br>
        In my spare time I really love lounging around, playing on my PS4, watching rubbish TV and hanging with my friends. I'm also a fan of chilling on my laptop spending far too much money shopping online (curse you beauty bay) and watching endless hours of youtube videos.
        </br></br>
        I also recently decided to start up my own business last year, because who needs free time anyway? It's called 'Wicks and Match' and I sell home-made candles, made by yours truly! Check out my <a href="/candles.php">'Candle Shop'</a> page for more details.
