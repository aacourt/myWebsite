    I'm happen to be the proud owner of my own candle company *woops and hollers* called Wicks and Match. To visit my etsy store <a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/WicksAndMatchCandles" target="_blank"> click here</a>:

     Read on to hear the story of how Wicks and Match was born.

    Now let me tell you, I bloody love candles. When I moved house I had an entire crate filled with just candles. But one thing I also love is themed candles. Ever since I started up my FairyLoot box subscription, I fell in love with book themed candles. However I am also stingy. I found so many candles I loved the sound of on Etsy only to find they were based in america and shipping was like a bajillion pounds (more like Â£15 but still ouch worthy). So I had to look closer to home and look to UK based sellers, and don't get me wrong there are some incredible ones, however at that given time, they weren't selling ones I wanted, they didn't have the character one I wanted, or I liked the smell but had no idea what the theme was about. And then suddenly I had an overwhelming feeling of false confidence.
    </br></br>
    I began swaggering around my house exclaiming "ppffft I'll make my own candles, how hard can it be? Why, I'll even start my own business! YEAH!". So yeah turns out starting your own candle business is very hard. But after a lot of blood, sweat and tears, plus a lot of money spent and many a disformed candle later, I have finally done it.

    My niche is that I'm not focused just on book related candles, I'll be incorporating in films and tv too. Now Wicks and Match is very much still in its infancy. I'm currently work on some new candles to add to the permanent range, keep an eye out!
